# Contributing to LibreBooking

First off, thank you for considering contributing to LibreBooking. We
appreciate your interest and effort. This project is open-source and needs
community contributions.

We welcome many forms of contributions, including but not limited to:

* Reporting bugs
* Suggesting new features or enhancements
* Improving documentation
* Writing tutorials or blog posts
* Submitting pull requests for bug fixes or new features

## Issue Management and Our Approach to Contributions

We value every contribution and bug report. However, as an open-source project
with limited maintainer resources, we rely heavily on the community to help us
move forward.

**Our Policy on Inactive Issues:**

To keep our issue tracker manageable and focused on actionable items, we have
the following approach:

* **We encourage reporters to propose solutions:** If you report an issue, we
strongly encourage you to also think about how it might be fixed and try to
implement that fix.
* **Community interest is key:** Issues that garner interest from the community
(e.g., multiple users confirming, discussions on solutions, offers to help) are
more likely to be addressed.
* **Closing inactive issues:** If an issue report doesn't receive a proposed
fix from the original reporter or anyone else in the community, and there's no
active discussion or indication that someone is willing to work on it after a
reasonable period, it may be closed.

  * When closing such an issue, we will typically leave a comment explaining
  that it's being closed due to inactivity and a lack of a proposed fix.

* **Reopening issues:** This doesn't mean the issue isn't valid. If you (or
someone else) are interested in working on a fix for a closed issue, please
comment on the issue. We are more than happy to reopen it and discuss your
proposed pull request or solution. We greatly appreciate it when community
members take ownership of fixing issues they care about.

We believe this approach helps us focus our efforts effectively and empowers
the community to contribute directly to the areas they are most passionate
about.

## Getting Started

* *Ensure you have an up-to-date `main` branch:** Fork the repository and make
sure your `main` branch is synced with the upstream project before creating
your feature branch.
* **Create a new branch** for your changes: `git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name` or `git checkout -b bugfix/issue-number-and-fix`.
* **Make your changes** and **add tests** if applicable.
* **Ensure your code lints**
* **Commit your changes** with a clear and descriptive commit message.
* **Push your branch** to your fork: `git push origin feature/your-feature-name`.
* **Open a Pull Request** against our `main` branch.

## Reporting Bugs

Before submitting a new bug report, please:

* **Check existing issues:** Search the issue tracker to see if the bug has already been reported.
* **Provide a clear title and description:** Explain the issue and include as much relevant information as possible.
* **Describe how to reproduce the bug:** Include steps, code snippets, or a minimal reproducible example.
* **Explain the expected behavior vs. actual behavior.**
* **Include details about your environment:** Operating system, project version, browser version, etc.

## Suggesting Enhancements

We'd love to hear your ideas for improving LibreBooking.

* **Check existing issues and discussions:** Your idea might have already been discussed.
* **Provide a clear title and description:** Explain the enhancement and why it would be beneficial.
* **Outline your proposed solution if you have one.**
* **Be open to discussion:** We may have questions or alternative suggestions.

## Pull Request Process

1. Ensure any install or build dependencies are removed before the end of the layer when doing a build.
2. Update the README.md with details of changes to the interface, this includes new environment variables, exposed ports, useful file locations, and container parameters.
3. Increase the version numbers in any examples files and the README.md to the new version that this Pull Request would represent. The versioning scheme we use is [SemVer](http://semver.org/).
4. Your PR will be reviewed by maintainers. We aim to review PRs in a timely manner, but please be patient.
5. Address any feedback or requested changes.
6. Once your PR is approved and CI checks pass, it will be merged. Thank you for your contribution.
